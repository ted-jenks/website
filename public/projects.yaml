  description: |
    The sheer volume of news these days makes it very hard to make sense of the world around us. To help with this, I co-developed Big Tech Visualisation. This app presents a graph of the tech industry derived from WikiData and populates it with current stories related to each node. 
    
    Articles are analysed with NLP and the areas they effect can be identified in real time. Multiple sources are scraped for articles, keeping the visualisation up to date and unbiased. See the demo presented by my team mate Jonas in the video that comes up on click.
